I recently volunteered to help a ninth grader write an essay through [826 Valencia](http://826valencia.org/). We were tasked as part of the [Young Author’s Book Project](http://826valencia.org/our-programs/publishing/) to write an essay on “This I Believe” to be published as part of a book by the students. By the end, each student would be published authors in their teens. Our job was to help them articulate a belief they held and then assist them in explaining it to a reading audience.

The student I worked with was an avid reader. She was obviously smart and very well-read. She shared with me her favorite books and authors like [Artemis Fowl](http://www.artemisfowl.com/) and [Hayao Myazaki](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hayao_Miyazaki_). We talked about the morals and beliefs in some of her favorite books and shows — her earnest belief was that she was young and hadn’t “lived” yet. The world she understood and the experiences she had were tied to the characters and stories she read. They were her lens to the world. They helped her articulate the way she saw the world and the way she wanted to act within it. Reading was a joy but also an experience gym for her — a way to understand and relate to complicated world with often convoluted emotions.

It was hard for her to bring these large truths to her apparently ordinary and unspectacular world. She was embarrassed to read her essay too loudly and worried (I think) that compared to such stunning literature that her voice and limited experience didn’t register on these grand scales.

I pushed her to go out of her comfort zone — but my heart also ached for her. I remember those feelings. I remember losing myself in stories and being amazed at how you could jump into a character’s mind and understand what this “person” was  thinking — sometimes it was different from you and sometimes it was spot on to the thoughts you’d have in the same scrape. I would find traits in heroines that I wanted to emulate and follow adventurous characters to imaginary places. I loved the bookish and independent Jo in [Little Women](http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/act-four/wp/2015/03/23/intermission-little-women-again/), and [The Giver](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Giver) blew my mind (if you haven’t read it, it’s essentially a Plato primer for kids that asks what if the world wasn’t as it appeared.)

My favorite book and heroine by far was Anne in [Anne of Green Gables](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anne_of_Green_Gables_). She was an orphan adopted around the turn of the century by an old maid and her bachelor brother on Prince Edward Island in Canada. This spunky redhead was trying to be good, and in her earnest way with a vivid imagination, she would end up in all types of scrapes — she climbed ridge poles (like another heroine Pippy Longstocking) and created imaginary ghosts in the Haunted Wood. Along with being fearsomely smart and creative, she was unerringly optimistic with a charisma that made all the other characters love her.

She was also the character that introduced me to the concept and namesake of this blog: kindred spirits. She used this term to refer to the people in Anne’s world that intimately understand her true and good nature.  

“Kindred spirits are not so scarce as I used to think. It's splendid to find out there are so many of them in the world.” — Anne Shirley

Anne’s kindred spirits are limited to characters in her fictional world. However, in my young (and now older) heart, I always thought of Anne as my first kindred spirit. Kindred spirits were people that I loved and were excited to meet. She was the one that helped me articulate an understanding that I had about how the world worked and my place in it. She gave a name to a concept that I inherently felt and understood.

In this blog, my aim is to explore my personal and professional world through the lens of books and (let’s be honest) other media. It’s book club meets personal blog.  

I’m excited to start this journey. Thanks for reading!
